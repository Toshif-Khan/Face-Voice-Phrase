# Face-Voice-Phrase

In this project we are doing a three level authentication process. The level of authentication as follows : 

1) In this level we will Identify the face of user. If we found an known face then after we will go for second level 

2) In this level of authentication we will authenticate user by his/her voice. User will give his voice through microphone then we will      get a known voice then we will match the identity of Voice with the identity of Face, If we found the same identity for both means the    face and voice is given by the same person then only we will go for third level

3) In this last level of authentication we will authenticate user by his/her phrase (Phrase is like a unique statement which is registered    with your voice only), If we found a valid phrase then only we will complete authentication. The main thing about this level is that we
   we will only verify phrase by your voice only. It means that if someone comes and speak your phrase then we will not verify it, because    it is not your voice. And one thing also, If you came and speak another phrase then we will again not verify it, because it is not your
   right phrase. 
   
   Is it not cool huhh!!!
   
   Means as of now your transaction is more and more secure no one can theft your identity.



This is all.
